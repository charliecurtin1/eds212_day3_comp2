## Vectors in R

```{r}
# every element in a vector has to be the same class, or R will make them all the same class
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)

class(marmots)

marmots
```

```{r}
# use class to check object classes, good thing to check whenever data viz isn't working as intended. quick check you can just do in the console
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 8, 7, 9)

class(pika)
```

```{r}
# integer values

bear <- c(1L, 3L, 5L, 18L)
```
